# Copilot Custom Instructions

## Important Guidelines

### Do NOT modify the `dist/` folder
- The `dist/` folder contains built artifacts that are automatically generated
- Never manually edit files in the `dist/` folder
- These files are built from the source code during the build process
- Any manual changes to `dist/` files will be overwritten during the next build
- If you need to make changes, modify the source files in `src/` instead and rebuild

### Build Process
- The project uses esbuild to compile TypeScript source files from `src/` into `dist/`
- Run `npm run build` to regenerate the `dist/` folder after making source changes
- The `dist/` folder should only be updated through the official build process

### Pull Request Guidelines
- Do not include `dist/` folder changes in pull requests unless specifically requested
- Focus changes on source files, configuration, and documentation
- Let the maintainers handle `dist/` folder updates through their build process
